This is an end to end ML project to predict studentsâ€™ exam scores based on demographic and contextual input variables such as race, gender, parental education level, and lunch status. The goal was to build an
interactive predictive tool for educational performance analysis.
The project uses data sourced from Kaggle and applies machine learning techniques to model the relationship between student background factors and academic performance. The final solution provides
insights for educators and policymakers through a user-friendly web application.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering were performed on the data followed by hyperparameter tuning the machine learning model to select select the best performing one.
This project features a ML pipeline integrated into a Flask-based web application for user interaction and real time predictions.
A Github workflow script was also created to containerize the web application using docker and deploy it on an Azure Web App
